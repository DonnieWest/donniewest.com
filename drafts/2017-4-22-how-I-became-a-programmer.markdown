When I first set out to be become a programmer I made _so many_ mistakes along the way. I wasn't consistent, I wasn't always coding and I lacked confidence in myself. If you're learning to code here are a few pointers to help you get started and hopefully avoid the issues I ran into.

## Find a Mentor

You _will_ need a mentor.

Stealing a page from [James Altucher's article on reinventing yourself](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2013/12/ultimate-cheat-sheet-reinventing-self-2/) then by reading this I have become an _indirect_ mentor. A good mentor that directs you in meatspace however is worth several hundred indirect mentors. Either way, the only way you'll become a programmer is by finding lots of mentors to guide you on your way. Direct mentors can help guide you more intimately and save you hundreds of hours in wasted time going down paths that won't help you. You can find these people through some simple networking, starting with close friends and family and outward to the point that you're emailing absolute strangers. It's worth the extra effort needed to find out. Several hours of emails to find one mentor is worth it.

In my case, I found a friend from church who was willing to bring me into an OSS project he was working on that helped propell me into my current career.

Follow people everywhere (I love twitter) who are prominent in the community to keep a pulse on the industry.

"Have faith in me who has faith in you!"

## Stay Consistent

Once you have a mentor, it's important to remain consistent. Choose a programming language to learn, honestly any will do though preferably one your mentor knows and understands well enough to help you with. Find a curriculum that teaches that language and stick with it to the very end under the direction of your mentor. If you don't know where to start and have no one to direct you, check out [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) which has an excellent path from knowing absolutely nothing all the way to understanding Web development and get a job. Try to stay away from esoteric languages like Scala or Haskell that doesn't have a huge commnity. _Community is very important_.

## Always be Coding

You can often subsitute on the job experience with a tool with OSS projects

Often you learn WAY MORE doing personal projects vs doing something on the job since you have way more creative freedom. The catch for most people working a job is that they typically have more time to work on solutions and a strong network that comes with the company that they work for.

### Create projects and post them on Github

### Do as much as you can as frequently as you can

[Same thing that works for blogging works for coding](https://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/). The more software you write the better a coder you are.

## Imposter Syndrome is fierce

Your greatest challenge now is going to be your greatest accomplishment later.

Here's a not-so-secret - I practically talked people out of hiring me. It's true. Imposter Syndrome makes you feel like you're not hirable when you might be. 

Apply everywhere. Ask for feedback. Learn what companies are looking for and gain those skills so that the next interview will go better. Get used to rejection.

### You can do a lot with little knowledge

[Look at your heroes and mourn](https://mobile.twitter.com/tylermcginnis33/status/854080450637254660)

Realize that they probably started off with little more knowledge than you have now and yet aspired to create things to the fullest extent of their skills. They wasted no time and neither should you.

## Learn simple but uncommon skills

There's a lot of conventional wisdom around teaching people new to programming that they shouldn't learn skill X because it's way too hard. Unfortunately, it's often understanding those minute distinctions that will make you an exponentially better programmer. When someone gets "hand wavy" about a topic, do a little research into whether or not it's _really_ as intimidating as they make it out to be. If it isn't, _learn it_ and shock them when they see you again. It'll give you a leg up over all the other beginner programmers that have had their curiosity squelched by others. I know this is a bit contradictory when I've also told you to get a mentor, but sometimes you _do_ have to go beyond what others tell you to do. Here are some hints on skills that intimidate others but can be picked up relatively easily.

Note: none of these are strictly necessary. They should probably be learned in parallel with your language/curriculum and not in substitution. They are force multipliers on your skills

In general, look to acquire skills piecemeal that make you much more productive and implement them immediately. Never feel comfortable stopping and throw away any skills you don't find strictly necessary.

Learn these skills in isolation/sandbox. Picking up a Raspberry Pi for Linux or creating a dummy repository for git is useful and will help you go far.

### Git

I've met many reasonably skilled programmers who are completely allergic to the idea of using Git beyond a simple `git add`, `git commit` `git push` flow. By understanding a _little_ more than that, you can really wow people who are looking to hire you. I'd recommend going through Github's [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) at first and then practice doing that on your own projects. After you have the basics down the biggest thing to learn is how to rebase: it may be scary, but it's seriously magic to a lot of programmers and is worth the early effort to learn. By learning git early on, you open yourself up to an entire world of developer collaboration.

Rebasing is often used in the OSS to keep things "Clean" - use it sparingly, but learn how to do it

#### Contribute to OSS projects that you're wanting to use

Start early and try to add contributions to the Open source projects that you're using as a beginner. If there's something confusing to you, save someone else the mental effort of figuring it out and either contribute back to the documentation or write a blog post describing what you learned. There's always someone a week behind you that could benefit and it'll give you the confidence down the road to contribute features or bug fixes to your favorite project.

### Learn an Editor and Stick to It

Pragmatic Programmer Tip 22 - Use a Single Editor well

Choose an Editor, know it thoroughly and use it for all editting tasks. If you use an editor (or set of keybindings) across all text editing activities, you won't have to stop and think to accomplish test manipulation: the necessary keystrokes will be a reflex. The editor will be an extension of your hand; the keys will sing as they slice their way through text and thought. That's our goal.

### Unix tools

[Unix can be used as an IDE](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/)

[Learn enough command line to be dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)

Yes, if you use VIM or Linux this is a bit redundant. Learn the general tools necessary to perform tasks without the UI

VIM forces you to do this often

Learning Linux has been the most impactful thing for my career bar none. By learning how to install your own operating system, you will gain a mastery of fundamental tools of the programmer trade and acquire skills that few others (except perhaps your devops guy) understand. The best way I've found to learn is to have a throwaway environment of sorts: assuming you don't know what a VM is, I'd recommend picking up a Raspberry Pi and installing Linux on it and becoming comfortable with Linux on it before eventually installing it on your main computer. By offloading the initial install to a third party computer, you can gain Linux skills without putting your main use laptop at risk from early mistakes and a Raspberry Pi is pretty painless to start over again on.

So, yeah, don't make the same mistakes I made: have _some confidence_ in yourself, stay consistent and get yourself a mentor and you'll go far :)
