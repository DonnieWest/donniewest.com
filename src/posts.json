We also <em>hate</em> boilerplate and unfortunately it seems like all of our new React Native projects use the same libraries and the same initial boilerplate. We decided to eliminate that boilerplate with React Native CLI’s new unspoken feature: project templates. With this feature, you too can eliminate boilerplate and speed along the production of your new shiny React Native apps.</p>\n<h2>How to use React Native project templates</h2>\n<p>If you’ve not heard of them before, <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.42.3\">React 0.42</a> quietly released a feature that allows a user to specify a template for a newly initialized React Native app and even bundled a template that demonstrated how to build an app with navigation. Even cooler, you can also specify npm packages to create the new app from like so:</p>\n<pre><code>react-native init <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span><span class=\"hljs-type\">App</span> --template koality\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I’m going to show you how to build your own.</p>\n<h2>Initialize</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the tooling for creating a template compatible with React Native’s cli is nonexistent. The solution we’re going to use here is to leverage the existing architecture around creating a React Native app and change the end product into a template. Let’s start by initializing our React Native project.</p>\n<pre><code>react-native init &lt;your <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">sample</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">app</span> template name here&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Code</h2>\n<p>Here’s where I leave it up to your imagination. In the case of our team, we created a <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeKoalas/koality-react-native-template\">super basic app template</a> that integrated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React Router</li>\n<li>Redux</li>\n<li>Redux persist</li>\n<li>Styled Components</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and other basic bits of boilerplate necessary to start most of our internal projects. I recommend keeping this template fairly minimal so that you don’t spend time replacing libraries or ripping out parts you don’t need and therefore wasting more time than you end up saving.</p>\n<h2>Clean</h2>\n<p>After you’re done coding and the app looks about like you would want, it’s time to actually turn it into a React Native template. Start by modifying your package.json which probably looks like this by now.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"sample\"</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"0.0.1\"</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"private\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"scripts\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"start\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"node node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js start\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"test\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"jest\"</span>\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"dependencies\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"react\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"16.0.0-alpha.6\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"react-native\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"0.43.3\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"react-router-native\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"^4.0.0\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"react-router-redux\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"^4.0.8\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"redux\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"^3.6.0\"</span>\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"devDependencies\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"babel-jest\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"19.0.0\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"babel-preset-react-native\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"1.9.1\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"jest\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"19.0.2\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"react-test-renderer\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"16.0.0-alpha.6\"</span>\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"jest\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"preset\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"react-native\"</span>\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Start by creating a dependencies.json file and move your dependencies object from the package.json file to the dependencies.json file</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"react-router-native\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"^4.0.0\"</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"react-router-redux\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"^4.0.8\"</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"redux\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"^3.6.0\"</span>\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Sadly, react native templates don’t support installing dev dependencies. See the conclusion for a workaround</p>\n<p>From here, it’s time to strip out the entries in the package.json file that are no longer needed. Remove the dependencies, scripts, dev dependencies and anything else you don’t need from the package.json. Finally, rename your template in the format <code>react-native-template-&lt;your name here&gt;</code>. For example, when a user specifies the “sample” template via <code>--template sample</code>, React Native will look for the npm package “react-native-template-sample” instead of the npm package called “sample”</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"react-native-template-sample\"</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"0.0.1\"</span>\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Don’t leave behind the dependencies block or anything unneeded in the package.json. React Native’s CLI will ignore the package.json for the generated app and the additional installed depdendencies in your package.json can cause problems. In my case, React Native would install during the template creation and create extra native directories that would fail to compile.</p>\n<p>You also need to delete any directories containing native code that might interfere with your generated app.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">rm</span> -rf ./android\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">rm</span> -rf ./ios\n</code></pre>\n<p>Project templates also have a nifty feature so that if you put the string <code>HelloWorld</code> in your template anywhere, it’ll get substituted with the project name supplied by the consumer of the template. The biggest place to watch out for this is in the index.ios.js and index.android.js where you register your app by name. Change the registration code to the following in both files:</p>\n<pre><code>...your code here\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'HelloWorld'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span> =&gt;</span> App);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Be sure to also substitute anywhere else in your template that you use the app name with ‘HelloWorld’</p>\n<h2>Publish</h2>\n<p>You can now test your template by running the following commands</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Initialize a new project pointing to the template you just made on your filesystem</span>\nreact-native init test <span class=\"hljs-comment\">--template file://path/to/your/template</span>\ncd test\nreact-native <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">run</span>-android <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># or run-ios if that's your jam</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>If your app runs successfully, congratulations! It works!</p>\n<p>Now you have a template worthy of publishing. You can put it up on the npm registry for all to use and/or push it up to Github for others to see the source. It’s totally up to you!</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>React Native projects typically start off with a lot of chores needed to get up and running. Now with the knowledge of React Native’s project template feature you can remove that boilerplate and get to coding faster.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<h3>Caveats with project templates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dev Dependencies: basically have to write a script to initialize your dev dependencies yourself\n<ul>\n<li>We tackled that by stealing a postInstall script from <a href=\"https://github.com/doomsower/react-native-template-starter/blob/f6cd738d8352e53758ce8504f74464f8a407149e/scripts/postInit.js\">react-native-template-starter</a></li>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeKoalas/koality-react-native-template/blob/master/scripts/setupDevDependencies.js\">our version of the script</a> that can choose between yarn and npm and installs only dev dependencies for you</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Incompatibility with other CLI tools, namely haul and create-react-native-app</li>\n<li>Poor documentation, not sure if this will change or get better with time</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Alternatives</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://infinite.red/ignite\">Ignite 2.0</a>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignite is a powerful CLI that gives you a lot of control out of the box for generating cool React Native apps</li>\n<li>If you tend to stick with the same stack or end up not needing a lot of Ignite’s stuff, probably worth creating your own template</li>\n<li>If your favorite library isn’t supported, have to still add it every time</li>\n<li>Note: You can simply take the generated Ignite app and strip it down into your own RN template</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;term=react+native\">Code Canyon</a>, <a href=\"https://strapmobile.com/\">Strap Mobile</a> or other online template stores\n<ul>\n<li>Not OSS</li>\n<li>Unless your app matches their example closely, you’re probably going to make major modifications</li>\n<li>Can’t see what you’re getting until you’ve already purchased it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hand rolled ala <a href=\"http://yeoman.io/\">Yeoman</a> or Custom script\n<ul>\n<li>You end up writing a lot more code to arrive at the same result</li>\n<li>A lot more error prone</li>\n<li>Infinitely more flexible than any of the options presented</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"eliminate-boilerplate-with-react-native-templates","excerpt":"At Code Koalas, we love React Native.

Unfortunately, few understand the power of VIM’s plugin system and the ability to get most of the features of your typical IDE in VIM itself. At the end of this guide, you should have proper autocompletion for your javascript files, jump to definition, linting and syntax checking all from your favorite text editor.There are some prerequisites, however. We assume that you have:</p>\n<p>A. A computer setup with Neovim (a good initial guide on setup can be found <a href=\"http://veelenga.com/editors/how-to-start-using-neovim-instead-of-vim/\">here</a>)\nB. Neovim package installed from python <a href=\"https://github.com/neovim/python-client\">following the guide from here</a>\nC. A recent version of Node (At the time of this guide, Node was at v4.5.0 for LTS and 6.5.0 for current, but anything recent should work)\nD. A basic knowledge of how to configure Neovim</p>\n<p>tl;dr - you can look at the config at the bottom of this post for a minimal drop in configuration for your neovim</p>\n<h2>1. A quick introduction to Vim-Plug</h2>\n<p>If you’ve never handled VIM’s plugin system before it can be quite daunting. Luckily for us, there are a number of projects that make plugin management easy for the typical user. Vim Plug one of the more popular plugin managers that aims to be minimal, universally quick and easy to setup. It also has other more advanced features such as the ability to lazy load plugins until needed, running functions after a plugin installation and more which can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\">in it’s documentation</a>. To begin using vim-plug, we’ll first create a basic init.vim in ~/.config/nvim/init.vim that has the following contents</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Install Vim Plug if not installed</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">empty</span>(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">glob</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim'</span>))\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">silent</span> !curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span> --create-dirs\n    \\ http<span class=\"hljs-variable\">s:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">com</span>/junegunn/<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>-plug/master/plug.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">autocmd</span> VimEnter * PlugInstall\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">endif</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> plug#begin()\n\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> plug#end()\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will automatically download and install vim-plug for you on vim launch. Plugins are added in between the calls to <code>plug#begin()</code> and <code>plug#end()</code> and adding github shorthand that looks like <code>Plug 'ternjs/tern_for_vim'</code> which after running <code>:PlugInstall</code> would fetch the vim plugin hosted at <a href=\"https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim\">https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim</a>. We’ll go ahead and add that to our configuration now so our init.vim should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Install Vim Plug if not installed</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">empty</span>(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">glob</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim'</span>))\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">silent</span> !curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span> --create-dirs\n    \\ http<span class=\"hljs-variable\">s:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">com</span>/junegunn/<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>-plug/master/plug.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">autocmd</span> VimEnter * PlugInstall\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">endif</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> plug#begin()\n\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'ternjs/tern_for_vim'</span>, { <span class=\"hljs-string\">'do'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'npm install &amp;&amp; npm install -g tern'</span> }\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> plug#end()\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll notice that we run some commands here on your computer for you, installing both the vim plugin’s dependencies and a global tern package. This will help keep the plugin in sync with the global ternjs package installed on your computer and is just a hint of the power of vim-plug.</p>\n<h2>2. Deoplete and autocompletion</h2>\n<p>The global tern package is needed because it’s a generic server that all text editors can plug into, which the vim side of things being a client package that communicates with the server. This also allows us to configure the server on both a global scale and on a local scale. For now, we’ll configure it globally in a generic way for maximum benefit. Create a file in your home directory with the name .tern-config with the following contents:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"plugins\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"node\"</span>: {}\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default, this assumes ES6 and a few other defaults. It can be configured on a per project basis by adding a .tern-project in the root of the project with the configuration options found at <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html\">their documention</a>. Now that is setup, you should be able to open vim and run the <code>:PlugInstall</code> command to install your plugin. Then you can go into a javascript project and type <code>&lt;C-x&gt; &lt;C-o&gt;</code> to get completions on your javascript candidates.</p>\n<p>That’s all fine and good, but, this is only scratching the surface of Neovim’s powers. The Omnicompletion method we just set up blocks Neovim and isn’t automatically triggered during typing like we might expect from a full blown IDE. To solve this, we’re going to install Deoplete and some other plugins to get our full IDE abilities turned on. Let’s add these plugins now along with some basic config to get them working. Your config should look like this now:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Install Vim Plug if not installed</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">empty</span>(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">glob</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim'</span>))\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">silent</span> !curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span> --create-dirs\n    \\ http<span class=\"hljs-variable\">s:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">com</span>/junegunn/<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>-plug/master/plug.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">autocmd</span> VimEnter * PlugInstall\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">endif</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> plug#begin()\n\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>! <span class=\"hljs-title\">DoRemote</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(arg)</span></span>\n  UpdateRemotePlugins\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">endfunction</span>\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Shougo/deoplete.nvim'</span>, { <span class=\"hljs-string\">'do'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">('DoRemote')</span> }</span>\n\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'ternjs/tern_for_vim'</span>, { <span class=\"hljs-string\">'do'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'npm install &amp;&amp; npm install -g tern'</span> }\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'carlitux/deoplete-ternjs'</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> plug#end()\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_at_startup = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_ignore_case = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_smart_case = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_camel_case = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_refresh_always = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#max_abbr_width = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#max_menu_width = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#omni#input_patterns = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">get</span>(<span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">'deoplete#omni#input_patterns'</span>,{})\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tern_request_timeout</span> = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tern_request_timeout</span> = <span class=\"hljs-number\">6000</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tern</span>#command = [<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"tern\"</span>]\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tern</span>#arguments = [<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"--persistent\"</span>]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Deoplete is a generic autocomplete plugin that allows others to hook into it and provide completions for candidates on screen. It comes preconfigured with file path completion, ctags completion and for strings that appear in each of your vim buffers. deoplete-ternjs is another package that plugs into deoplete that provides completions using the ternjs server. After running <code>:PlugInstall</code> again, you should have a fully installed fuzzy completion engine for vim. You can try it out by typing following a <code>.</code> should trigger autocompletion for whatever object or function you’re calling.</p>\n<p>The other bits of configuration unlock a bit of the power of deoplete. It enables it to start when vim does, enable sane autocompletion based on the cases of your candidates among other things that can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim/blob/master/doc/deoplete.txt\">deoplete docs</a></p>\n<p>But we can still do better. In addition to the candidate completions generated by ternjs, we can also get candidate completion by typescript language services, the same tools used by popular IDEs such as Visual Studio. To do this, we’ll need to add a few more plugins so our init.vim should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\">\" Install Vim Plug if not installed</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">empty</span>(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">glob</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim'</span>))\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">silent</span> !curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span> --create-dirs\n    \\ http<span class=\"hljs-variable\">s:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">com</span>/junegunn/<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>-plug/master/plug.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">autocmd</span> VimEnter * PlugInstall\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">endif</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> plug#begin()\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>! <span class=\"hljs-title\">DoRemote</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(arg)</span></span>\n  UpdateRemotePlugins\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">endfunction</span>\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Shougo/deoplete.nvim'</span>, { <span class=\"hljs-string\">'do'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">('DoRemote')</span> }</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\"Javascript Plugins</span>\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'carlitux/deoplete-ternjs'</span>\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'ternjs/tern_for_vim'</span>, { <span class=\"hljs-string\">'do'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'npm install &amp;&amp; npm install -g tern'</span> }\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">\"Typescript Plugins</span>\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Shougo/vimproc.vim'</span>, { <span class=\"hljs-string\">'do'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'make'</span> }\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Quramy/tsuquyomi'</span>, { <span class=\"hljs-string\">'do'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'npm install -g typescript'</span> }\nPlug <span class=\"hljs-string\">'mhartington/deoplete-typescript'</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> plug#end()\n\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_at_startup = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_ignore_case = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_smart_case = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_camel_case = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#enable_refresh_always = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#max_abbr_width = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#max_menu_width = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#omni#input_patterns = <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">get</span>(<span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:</span>,<span class=\"hljs-string\">'deoplete#omni#input_patterns'</span>,{})\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">call</span> deoplete#custom#set(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'_'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'matchers'</span>, [<span class=\"hljs-string\">'matcher_full_fuzzy'</span>])\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tern_request_timeout</span> = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tern_request_timeout</span> = <span class=\"hljs-number\">6000</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tern</span>#command = [<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"tern\"</span>]\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tern</span>#arguments = [<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"--persistent\"</span>]\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:deoplete</span>#sources#tss#javascript_support = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tsuquyomi_javascript_support</span> = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tsuquyomi_auto_open</span> = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:tsuquyomi_disable_quickfix</span> = <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This installs two major plugins: Tsuquyomi and deoplete-typescript. Both offer autocompletion based on typescript language services. The difference between them is Tsuquyomi provides some additional IDE features but only provides an omnifunc like tern_for_vim did. deoplete-typescript provides completions like deoplete-ternjs but without the IDE features. I generally like to run this in parallel with ternjs because they seem to offer different sets of completions for my javascript candidates and so fill in the gaps of one another. You should really check out <a href=\"https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi/blob/master/doc/tsuquyomi.txt\">tsuquyomi’s docs</a> to ensure you’re getting the most out of it such as automatic importing, but I won’t go into detail about that here. All you need to know for now is that the typescript server also needs configuration like ternjs did and is configured indepedently of vim. Each project you work on needs a basic config like so:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"compilerOptions\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"target\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"ES6\"</span>\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"exclude\"</span>: [\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"node_modules\"</span>\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will tell the typescript compiler that it’s targeting ES6 and will exclude the node_modules directory for it’s processing. If you’re using Typescript 2.0 (in RC stage at the time of this post) you can easily install typings for some of your libraries by running <code>npm install --save @typings/my_library_here</code> that will be automatically picked up by the compiler and used to provide completions for complex libraries.</p>\n<h2>4. Linting and syntax checking</h2>\n<p>Another major missing feature is automatic linting. On Neovim, we can use neomake. Simply drop into your init.vim with the following configurations to get linting for your favorite tool as long as it is in your path. To enable or disable a linter, just add this line and append or remove the ones you want</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:neomake_javascript_enabled_makers</span> = [<span class=\"hljs-string\">'eslint'</span>]\n</code></pre>\n<p>For some additional benefits, we’ll run Neomake on every file save and configure the warning signs to our liking:</p>\n<pre><code>autocmd! BufWritePost * Neomake\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> g:neomake_warning_sign = {\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">\\</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'text'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'?'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">\\</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'texthl'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'WarningMsg'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">\\</span> }\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> g:neomake_error_sign = {\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">\\</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'text'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'X'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">\\</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'texthl'</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">'ErrorMsg'</span>,\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">\\</span> }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will show signs in your vim gutter to show where the syntax and linting errors are for your project.</p>\n<h2>5. CTags</h2>\n<p>Ctags is a tool that outputs a tags file that can then be read by VIM for jumping to definition and other cool tricks. Ctags is pretty universally installable by most OS’s, but traditionally it has had rather poor support for Javascript. We’ll start by installing <a href=\"http://docs.ctags.io/en/latest/\">universal ctags</a> which is simply a fork of the exuberant ctags project with support for the latest version of Javascript. We’ll also install vim-gutentags to enable automatic generation of ctags by VIM upon opening a project. Drop this in your plugins section of your init.vim:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">Plug</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags'</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>After running <code>:PlugInstall</code> and opening a project, you should find a tags file in the root of your project. To jump to definition using ctags just hover over a defined variable or import statement and type <code>&lt;C-]&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is just scratching the surface of VIM and Neovim’s power and are just the plugins needed to get IDE functionality specific to Javascript. Hopefully this will keep you away from the big bulky IDE that is often used by programmer who feel that VIM is just not enough.

This is a way to hold myself accountable to the world as well as celebrate my successes throughout the year.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<h2>What went well</h2>\n<p><strong>Finding a Mentor.</strong> Although I believe strongly in self education, I don’t believe learning happens in a bubble. That’s why I sought out someone who already knew how to program in order to teach me how to become an expert programmer. My mentor has helped me see what I don’t know and brought me on a team of professionals to hone my skills. His help is continuing into the new year and it’s pretty awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>Discipline.</strong> In order to make any reasonable amount of progress, you need to have the grit to carry through your goals. It’s been my major weakness and I’m making daily progress. Working on a team has held me accountable to produce work on a regular basis and instill this discipline. My work as become far more regular and less like a rollercoaster of productivity and slothfulness. It’s still something I need to work on, but I still consider it a major victory for 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>Unashamed.</strong> Last year I <a href=\"http://donniewest.com/i-want-to-code/\">publicly declared</a> that I was ashamed of being in fast food and incessantly afraid of failure. This forced me to confront it and realize it’s a major factor that has been holding me back from accomplishing all that I could be. Instead of being ashamed on my job, I forced myself to dwell on the fact that it’s my grit that matters. Instead of being without a degree, I’m debt free. Losing my shame and fear has been a major victory for 2014.</p>\n<h2>What didn’t go well</h2>\n<p><strong>Seinfeld Method.</strong> Last year I had the intent to program daily - any day I did so, I just marked an X on the calendar and sought to not break the chain of X’s. It was an impossible goal: I have a full time job, a wife and 3 kids. I just simply don’t have the time! In many ways though I wasted my time unnecessarily and was not nearly as focused as I could have been. Wasting time has been a major weakness of mine and I need to become more laser focused on my goals.</p>\n<h2>What I’m working toward</h2>\n<p><strong>Job.</strong> I have been programming regularly for almost two years now. Unfortunately, this has mostly resulted in toy projects that aren’t real showcases of my knowledge or private team projects that cannot be shared with the world. It’s time to set aside the toys and become a professional programmer this year, even if it means I have to become an entrepreneur and employ myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Metrics.</strong> While writing this article one of the biggest issues I had was the lack of real numbers on how well I’ve improved over the last year. In 2015 I want to begin quantifying where I am and how I’ve improved over the year. I will learn in the open with at-least-monthly blog posts to showcase that knowledge. Privately, I want to begin tracking my exercise and where my money goes so I can begin those incremental steps toward greatness.</p>\n<p><strong>Family.</strong> As a Christian, husband and father I am the spiritual leader of my home. Through that leadership, I need to build my marriage and my family. This year I plan to begin weekly family devotions and bring my children through a catechism so I know I’m doing my duty as both husband and father.</p>\n<p>While I have little idea of where 2015 will take me, I hope to steer myself toward a year of transformation with these guiding principles. The start of doing things right.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Yep, I stole this format blatently from the wonderful <a href=\"http://jamesclear.com/2014-annual-review\">James Clear</a>.

The following is necessary to ensure VIM will use your RVM ruby instead of any system ruby versions that are installed (and also to prevent it from crashing on start).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup> The part that is awesome here is that the bundled VIM-ruby packages within VIM will now use your RVM ruby and the current gemset.</p>\n<pre><code>ln -s ~/.rvm/rubies/default/lib/libruby.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libruby.so\nln -s ~/.rvm/rubies/default/lib/libruby.so.2.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libruby.so.2.2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately, VIM doesn’t detect lua where Ubuntu installs it.

It means I procrastinate on projects I don’t know how to do. I spend endless amounts of time on tiny details. It means I don’t allow myself to fail. Which is why my fear of failure is destructive to me: it holds me back from progress. It’s a large part of my lack of discipline. I lack the self control to get up from my failures and try again. That’s the horrifying part of fearing failure. <em>When you fear failure, you only fail more.</em></p>\n<h2>I’m ashamed of where I am</h2>\n<p>For some time I’ve been haunted by the fact that I dropped out of college and lack a clear path to future success.
